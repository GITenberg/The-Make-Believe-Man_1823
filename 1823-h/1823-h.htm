    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had made up my mind that when my vacation came I would spend it seeking
      adventures. I have always wished for adventures, but, though I am old
      enough&mdash;I was twenty-five last October&mdash;and have always gone
      half-way to meet them, adventures avoid me. Kinney says it is my fault. He
      holds that if you want adventures you must go after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kinney sits next to me at Joyce &amp; Carboy&rsquo;s, the woollen manufacturers,
      where I am a stenographer, and Kinney is a clerk, and we both have rooms
      at Mrs. Shaw&rsquo;s boarding-house. Kinney is only a year older than myself,
      but he is always meeting with adventures. At night, when I have sat up
      late reading law, so that I may fit myself for court reporting, and in the
      hope that some day I may become a member of the bar, he will knock at my
      door and tell me some surprising thing that has just happened to him.
      Sometimes he has followed a fire-engine and helped people from a
      fire-escape, or he has pulled the shield off a policeman, or at the bar of
      the Hotel Knickerbocker has made friends with a stranger, who turns out to
      be no less than a nobleman or an actor. And women, especially beautiful
      women, are always pursuing Kinney in taxicabs and calling upon him for
      assistance. Just to look at Kinney, without knowing how clever he is at
      getting people out of their difficulties, he does not appear to be a man
      to whom you would turn in time of trouble. You would think women in
      distress would appeal to some one bigger and stronger; would sooner ask a
      policeman. But, on the contrary, it is to Kinney that women always run,
      especially, as I have said, beautiful women. Nothing of the sort ever
      happens to me. I suppose, as Kinney says, it is because he was born and
      brought up in New York City and looks and acts like a New York man, while
      I, until a year ago, have always lived at Fairport. Fairport is a very
      pretty harbor, but it does not train one for adventures. We arranged to
      take our vacation at the same time, and together. At least Kinney so
      arranged it. I see a good deal of him, and in looking forward to my
      vacation, not the least pleasant feature of it was that everything
      connected with Joyce &amp; Carboy and Mrs. Shaw&rsquo;s boarding-house would be
      left behind me. But when Kinney proposed we should go together, I could
      not see how, without being rude, I could refuse his company, and when he
      pointed out that for an expedition in search of adventure I could not
      select a better guide, I felt that he was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can see you don&rsquo;t believe that half the things I
      tell you have happened to me, really have happened. Now, isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To find the answer that would not hurt his feelings I hesitated, but he
      did not wait for my answer. He seldom does.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, on this trip,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you will see Kinney on the job. You
      won&rsquo;t have to take my word for it. You will see adventures walk up and eat
      out of my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our vacation came on the first of September, but we began to plan for it
      in April, and up to the night before we left New York we never ceased
      planning. Our difficulty was that having been brought up at Fairport,
      which is on the Sound, north of New London, I was homesick for a smell of
      salt marshes and for the sight of water and ships. Though they were only
      schooners carrying cement, I wanted to sit in the sun on the string-piece
      of a wharf and watch them. I wanted to beat about the harbor in a catboat,
      and feel the tug and pull of the tiller. Kinney protested that that was no
      way to spend a vacation or to invite adventure. His face was set against
      Fairport. The conversation of clam-diggers, he said, did not appeal to
      him; and he complained that at Fairport our only chance of adventure would
      be my capsizing the catboat or robbing a lobster-pot. He insisted we
      should go to the mountains, where we would meet what he always calls &ldquo;our
      best people.&rdquo; In September, he explained, everybody goes to the mountains
      to recuperate after the enervating atmosphere of the sea-shore. To this I
      objected that the little sea air we had inhaled at Mrs. Shaw&rsquo;s basement
      dining-room and in the subway need cause us no anxiety. And so, along
      these lines, throughout the sleepless, sultry nights of June, July, and
      August, we fought it out. There was not a summer resort within five
      hundred miles of New York City we did not consider. From the information
      bureaus and passenger agents of every railroad leaving New York, Kinney
      procured a library of timetables, maps, folders, and pamphlets,
      illustrated with the most attractive pictures of summer hotels, golf
      links, tennis courts, and boat-houses. For two months he carried on a
      correspondence with the proprietors of these hotels; and in comparing the
      different prices they asked him for suites of rooms and sun parlors
      derived constant satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Outlook House,&rdquo; he would announce, &ldquo;wants twenty-four dollars a day
      for bedroom, parlor, and private bath. While for the same accommodations
      the Carteret Arms asks only twenty. But the Carteret has no tennis court;
      and then again, the Outlook has no garage, nor are dogs allowed in the
      bedrooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Kinney could not play lawn tennis, and as neither of us owned an
      automobile or a dog, or twenty-four dollars, these details to me seemed
      superfluous, but there was no health in pointing that out to Kinney.
      Because, as he himself says, he has so vivid an imagination that what he
      lacks he can &ldquo;make believe&rdquo; he has, and the pleasure of possession is his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kinney gives a great deal of thought to his clothes, and the question of
      what he should wear on his vacation was upon his mind. When I said I
      thought it was nothing to worry about, he snorted indignantly. &ldquo;YOU
      wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;D been brought up in a catboat, and had a tan
      like a red Indian, and hair like a Broadway blonde, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry
      either. Mrs. Shaw says you look exactly like a British peer in disguise.&rdquo;
       I had never seen a British peer, with or without his disguise, and I admit
      I was interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are the girls in this house,&rdquo; demanded Kinney, &ldquo;always running to
      your room to borrow matches? Because they admire your CLOTHES? If they&rsquo;re
      crazy about clothes, why don&rsquo;t they come to ME for matches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always out at night,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s not the answer,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Why do the type-writer
      girls at the office always go to YOU to sharpen their pencils and tell
      them how to spell the hard words? Why do the girls in the lunch-rooms
      serve you first? Because they&rsquo;re hypnotized by your clothes? Is THAT it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they?&rdquo; I asked; &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t noticed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinney snorted and tossed up his arms. &ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t noticed!&rdquo; he kept
      repeating. &ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t noticed!&rdquo; For his vacation Kinney bought a
      second-hand suit-case. It was covered with labels of hotels in France and
      Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if you carry that bag you will be a walking falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinney&rsquo;s name is Joseph Forbes Kinney; he dropped the Joseph because he
      said it did not appear often enough in the Social Register, and could be
      found only in the Old Testament, and he has asked me to call him Forbes.
      Having first known him as &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; I occasionally forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is NOT Joe,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;and I have as much right to carry
      a second-hand bag as a new one. The bag says IT has been to Europe. It
      does not say that I have been there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, you probably will,&rdquo; I pointed out, &ldquo;and then some one who has really
      visited those places&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; commanded Kinney. &ldquo;If you want adventures you must be somebody
      of importance. No one will go shares in an adventure with Joe Kinney, a
      twenty-dollar-a-week clerk, the human adding machine, the hall-room boy.
      But Forbes Kinney, Esq., with a bag from Europe, and a Harvard ribbon
      round his hat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a Harvard ribbon round your hat?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is!&rdquo; declared Kinney; &ldquo;and I have a Yale ribbon, and a Turf Club
      ribbon, too. They come on hooks, and you hook &lsquo;em on to match your
      clothes, or the company you keep. And, what&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; he continued, with
      some heat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve borrowed a tennis racket and a golf bag full of sticks,
      and you take care you don&rsquo;t give me away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;that you are going to get us into a lot of trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; said Kinney, looking at me rather doubtfully, &ldquo;it might
      help a lot if for the first week you acted as my secretary, and during the
      second week I was your secretary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, when Mr. Joyce goes on a business trip, he takes me with him as
      his private stenographer, and the change from office work is very
      pleasant; but I could not see why I should spend one week of my holiday
      writing letters for Kinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t write any letters,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;But if I could tell
      people you were my private secretary, it would naturally give me a certain
      importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it will make you any happier,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you can tell people I am a
      British peer in disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no use in being nasty about it,&rdquo; protested Kinney. &ldquo;I am only
      trying to show you a way that would lead to adventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It surely would!&rdquo; I assented. &ldquo;It would lead us to jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last week in August came, and, as to where we were to go we still were
      undecided, I suggested we leave it to chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first thing,&rdquo; I pointed out, &ldquo;is to get away from this awful city.
      The second thing is to get away cheaply. Let us write down the names of
      the summer resorts to which we can travel by rail or by boat for two
      dollars and put them in a hat. The name of the place we draw will be the
      one for which we start Saturday afternoon. The idea,&rdquo; I urged, &ldquo;is in
      itself full of adventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinney agreed, but reluctantly. What chiefly disturbed him was the thought
      that the places near New York to which one could travel for so little
      money were not likely to be fashionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a terrible fear,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;that, with this limit of yours, we
      will wake up in Asbury Park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Friday night came and found us prepared for departure, and at midnight we
      held our lottery. In a pillow-case we placed twenty slips of paper, on
      each of which was written the name of a summer resort. Ten of these places
      were selected by Kinney, and ten by myself. Kinney dramatically rolled up
      his sleeve, and, plunging his bared arm into our grab-bag, drew out a slip
      of paper and read aloud: &ldquo;New Bedford, via New Bedford Steamboat Line.&rdquo;
       The choice was one of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New Bedford!&rdquo; shouted Kinney. His tone expressed the keenest
      disappointment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mill town!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s full of cotton
      mills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s also a most picturesque old seaport,
      one of the oldest in America. You can see whaling vessels at the wharfs
      there, and wooden figure-heads, and harpoons&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this an expedition to dig up buried cities,&rdquo; interrupted Kinney, &ldquo;or a
      pleasure trip? I don&rsquo;t WANT to see harpoons! I wouldn&rsquo;t know a harpoon if
      you stuck one into me. I prefer to see hatpins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Patience did not sail until six o&rsquo;clock, but we were so anxious to put
      New York behind us that at five we were on board. Our cabin was an outside
      one with two berths. After placing our suit-cases in it, we collected
      camp-chairs and settled ourselves in a cool place on the boat deck. Kinney
      had bought all the afternoon papers, and, as later I had reason to
      remember, was greatly interested over the fact that the young Earl of Ivy
      had at last arrived in this country. For some weeks the papers had been
      giving more space than seemed necessary to that young Irishman and to the
      young lady he was coming over to marry. There had been pictures of his
      different country houses, pictures of himself; in uniform, in the robes he
      wore at the coronation, on a polo pony, as Master of Fox-hounds. And there
      had been pictures of Miss Aldrich, and of HER country places at Newport
      and on the Hudson. From the afternoon papers Kinney learned that, having
      sailed under his family name of Meehan, the young man and Lady Moya, his
      sister, had that morning landed in New York, but before the reporters had
      discovered them, had escaped from the wharf and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Inquiries at the different hotels,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Kinney impressively, &ldquo;&lsquo;failed
      to establish the whereabouts of his lordship and Lady Moya, and it is
      believed they at once left by train for Newport.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With awe Kinney pointed at the red funnels of the Mauretania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the boat that brought them to America,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;that in this picture of him playing golf he wears one of those
      knit jackets the Eiselbaum has just marked down to three dollars and
      seventy-five cents. I wish&mdash;&rdquo; he added regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can get one at New Bedford,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we had gone to Newport. All of our BEST people
      will be there for the wedding. It is the most important social event of
      the season. You might almost call it an alliance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went forward to watch them take on the freight, and Kinney stationed
      himself at the rail above the passengers gangway where he could see the
      other passengers arrive. He had dressed himself with much care, and was
      wearing his Yale hat-band, but when a very smart-looking youth came up the
      gangplank wearing a Harvard ribbon, Kinney hastily retired to our cabin
      and returned with one like it. A few minutes later I found him and the
      young man seated in camp-chairs side by side engaged in a conversation in
      which Kinney seemed to bear the greater part. Indeed, to what Kinney was
      saying the young man paid not the slightest attention. Instead, his eyes
      were fastened on the gangplank below, and when a young man of his own age,
      accompanied by a girl in a dress of rough tweed, appeared upon it, he
      leaped from his seat. Then with a conscious look at Kinney, sank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl in the tweed suit was sufficiently beautiful to cause any man to
      rise and to remain standing. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever
      seen. She had gray eyes and hair like golden-rod, worn in a fashion with
      which I was not familiar, and her face was so lovely that in my surprise
      at the sight of it, I felt a sudden catch at my throat, and my heart
      stopped with awe, and wonder, and gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a brief moment the young man in the real Harvard hat-band rose
      restlessly and, with a nod to Kinney, went below. I also rose and followed
      him. I had an uncontrollable desire to again look at the girl with the
      golden-rod hair. I did not mean that she should see me. Never before had I
      done such a thing. But never before had I seen any one who had moved me so
      strangely. Seeking her, I walked the length of the main saloon and back
      again, but could not find her. The delay gave me time to see that my
      conduct was impertinent. The very fact that she was so lovely to look upon
      should have been her protection. It afforded me no excuse to follow and
      spy upon her. With this thought, I hastily returned to the upper deck to
      bury myself in my book. If it did not serve to keep my mind from the young
      lady, at least I would prevent my eyes from causing her annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was about to take the chair that the young man had left vacant when
      Kinney objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was very much interested in our conversation,&rdquo; Kinney said, &ldquo;and he
      may return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not noticed any eagerness on the part of the young man to talk to
      Kinney or to listen to him, but I did not sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not be surprised a bit,&rdquo; said Kinney, &ldquo;if that young man is no
      end of a swell. He is a Harvard man, and his manner was most polite.
      That,&rdquo; explained Kinney, &ldquo;is one way you can always tell a real swell.
      They&rsquo;re not high and mighty with you. Their social position is so secure
      that they can do as they like. For instance, did you notice that he smoked
      a pipe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said I had not noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For his holiday Kinney had purchased a box of cigars of a quality more
      expensive than those he can usually afford. He was smoking one of them at
      the moment, and, as it grew less, had been carefully moving the gold band
      with which it was encircled from the lighted end. But as he spoke he
      regarded it apparently with distaste, and then dropped it overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep my chair,&rdquo; he said, rising. &ldquo;I am going to my cabin to get my pipe.&rdquo;
       I sat down and fastened my eyes upon my book; but neither did I understand
      what I was reading nor see the printed page. Instead, before my eyes,
      confusing and blinding me, was the lovely, radiant face of the beautiful
      lady. In perplexity I looked up, and found her standing not two feet from
      me. Something pulled me out of my chair. Something made me move it toward
      her. I lifted my hat and backed away. But the eyes of the lovely lady
      halted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my perplexity, her face expressed both surprise and pleasure. It was as
      though either she thought she knew me, or that I reminded her of some man
      she did know. Were the latter the case, he must have been a friend, for
      the way in which she looked at me was kind. And there was, besides, the
      expression of surprise and as though something she saw pleased her. Maybe
      it was the quickness with which I had offered my chair. Still looking at
      me, she pointed to one of the sky-scrapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you tell me,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;the name of that building?&rdquo; Had her
      question not proved it, her voice would have told me not only that she was
      a stranger, but that she was Irish. It was particularly soft, low, and
      vibrant. It made the commonplace question she asked sound as though she
      had sung it. I told her the name of the building, and that farther uptown,
      as she would see when we moved into midstream, there was another still
      taller. She listened, regarding me brightly, as though interested; but
      before her I was embarrassed, and, fearing I intruded, I again made a
      movement to go away. With another question she stopped me. I could see no
      reason for her doing so, but it was almost as though she had asked the
      question only to detain me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that odd boat,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;pumping water into the river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I explained that it was a fire-boat testing her hose-lines, and then as we
      moved into the channel I gained courage, and found myself pointing out the
      Statue of Liberty, Governors Island, and the Brooklyn Bridge. The fact
      that it was a stranger who was talking did not seem to disturb her. I
      cannot tell how she conveyed the idea, but I soon felt that she felt, no
      matter what unconventional thing she chose to do, people would not be
      rude, or misunderstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I considered telling her my name. At first it seemed that that would be
      more polite. Then I saw to do so would be forcing myself upon her, that
      she was interested in me only as a guide to New York Harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we passed the Brooklyn Navy Yard I talked so much and so eagerly of
      the battle-ships at anchor there that the lady must have thought I had
      followed the sea, for she asked: &ldquo;Are you a sailorman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first question that was in any way personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to sail a catboat,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      My answer seemed to puzzle her, and she frowned. Then she laughed
      delightedly, like one having made a discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;sailorman,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What do you ask, over here, when
      you want to know if a man is in the navy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke as though we were talking a different language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ask if he is in the navy,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again at that, quite as though I had said something clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am in Joyce &amp; Carboy&rsquo;s office. I am a stenographer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again my answer seemed both to puzzle and to surprise her. She regarded me
      doubtfully. I could see that she thought, for some reason, I was
      misleading her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an office?&rdquo; she repeated. Then, as though she had caught me, she said:
      &ldquo;How do you keep so fit?&rdquo; She asked the question directly, as a man would
      have asked it, and as she spoke I was conscious that her eyes were
      measuring me and my shoulders, as though she were wondering to what weight
      I could strip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only lately I&rsquo;ve worked in an office,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Before that I always
      worked out-of-doors; oystering and clamming and, in the fall, scalloping.
      And in the summer I played ball on a hotel nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that to the beautiful lady my explanation carried no meaning
      whatsoever, but before I could explain, the young man with whom she had
      come on board walked toward us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither did he appear to find in her talking to a stranger anything
      embarrassing. He halted and smiled. His smile was pleasant, but entirely
      vague. In the few minutes I was with him, I learned that it was no sign
      that he was secretly pleased. It was merely his expression. It was as
      though a photographer had said: &ldquo;Smile, please,&rdquo; and he had smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he joined us, out of deference to the young lady I raised my hat, but
      the youth did not seem to think that outward show of respect was
      necessary, and kept his hands in his pockets. Neither did he cease
      smoking. His first remark to the lovely lady somewhat startled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got a brass bed in your room?&rdquo; he asked. The beautiful lady said
      she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&rsquo;ve I,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;They do you rather well, don&rsquo;t they? And
      it&rsquo;s only three dollars. How much is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four times three would be twelve,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;Twelve shillings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man was smoking a cigarette in a long amber cigarette-holder. I
      never had seen one so long. He examined the end of his cigarette-holder,
      and, apparently surprised and relieved at finding a cigarette there, again
      smiled contentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovely lady pointed at the marble shaft rising above Madison Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the tallest sky-scraper,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in New York.&rdquo; I had just
      informed her of that fact. The young man smiled as though he were being
      introduced to the building, but exhibited no interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;IS it?&rdquo; he remarked. His tone seemed to show that had she said, &ldquo;That is
      a rabbit,&rdquo; he would have been equally gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; he stated, with the same startling abruptness with which he
      had made his first remark, &ldquo;our war-ships will lift the roofs off those
      sky-scrapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark struck me in the wrong place. It was unnecessary. Already I
      resented the manner of the young man toward the lovely lady. It seemed to
      me lacking in courtesy. He knew her, and yet treated her with no
      deference, while I, a stranger, felt so grateful to her for being what I
      knew one with such a face must be, that I could have knelt at her feet. So
      I rather resented the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the war-ships you send over here,&rdquo; I said doubtfully, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t more
      successful in lifting things than your yachts, you&rsquo;d better keep them at
      home and save coal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seldom have I made so long a speech or so rude a speech, and as soon as I
      had spoken, on account of the lovely lady, I was sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after a pause of half a second she laughed delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she cried, as though it were a sort of a game. &ldquo;He means Lipton!
      We can&rsquo;t lift the cup, we can&rsquo;t lift the roofs. Don&rsquo;t you see, Stumps!&rdquo;
       she urged. In spite of my rude remark, the young man she called Stumps had
      continued to smile happily. Now his expression changed to one of
      discomfort and utter gloom, and then broke out into a radiant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s awfully good: &lsquo;If your war-ships aren&rsquo;t any
      better at lifting things&mdash;&rsquo; Oh, I say, really,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      awfully good.&rdquo; He seemed to be afraid I would not appreciate the rare
      excellence of my speech. &ldquo;You know, really,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;it is AWFULLY
      good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were interrupted by the sudden appearance, in opposite directions, of
      Kinney and the young man with the real hat-band. Both were excited and
      disturbed. At the sight of the young man, Stumps turned appealingly to the
      golden-rod girl. He groaned aloud, and his expression was that of a boy
      who had been caught playing truant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s he huffy about now? He TOLD me I could
      come on deck as soon as we started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned upon me a sweet and lovely smile and nodded. Then, with
      Stumps at her side, she moved to meet the young man. When he saw them
      coming he halted, and, when they joined him, began talking earnestly,
      almost angrily. As he did so, much to my bewilderment, he glared at me. At
      the same moment Kinney grabbed me by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come below!&rdquo; he commanded. His tone was hoarse and thrilling with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our adventures,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;have begun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      I felt, for me, adventures had already begun, for my meeting with the
      beautiful lady was the event of my life, and though Kinney and I had
      agreed to share our adventures, of this one I knew I could not even speak
      to him. I wanted to be alone, where I could delight in it, where I could
      go over what she had said; what I had said. I would share it with no one.
      It was too wonderful, too sacred. But Kinney would not be denied. He led
      me to our cabin and locked the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;but this adventure is one I cannot share with
      you.&rdquo; The remark was so in keeping with my own thoughts that with sudden
      unhappy doubt I wondered if Kinney, too, had felt the charm of the
      beautiful lady. But he quickly undeceived me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been doing a little detective work,&rdquo; he said. His voice was low
      and sepulchral. &ldquo;And I have come upon a real adventure. There are reasons
      why I cannot share it with you, but as it develops you can follow it.
      About half an hour ago,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;I came here to get my pipe. The
      window was open. The lattice was only partly closed. Outside was that
      young man from Harvard who tried to make my acquaintance, and the young
      Englishman who came on board with that blonde.&rdquo; Kinney suddenly
      interrupted himself. &ldquo;You were talking to her just now,&rdquo; he said. I hated
      to hear him speak of the Irish lady as &ldquo;that blonde.&rdquo; I hated to hear him
      speak of her at all. So, to shut him off, I answered briefly: &ldquo;She asked
      me about the Singer Building.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Kinney. &ldquo;Well, these two men were just outside my window,
      and, while I was searching for my pipe, I heard the American speaking. He
      was very excited and angry. &lsquo;I tell you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;every boat and
      railroad station is watched. You won&rsquo;t be safe till we get away from New
      York. You must go to your cabin, and STAY there.&rsquo; And the other one
      answered: &lsquo;I am sick of hiding and dodging.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinney paused dramatically and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; he cried. He exclaimed aloud with pity and impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you never have adventures. Why, it&rsquo;s plain as
      print. They are criminals escaping. The Englishman certainly is escaping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was concerned only for the lovely lady, but I asked: &ldquo;You mean the
      Irishman called Stumps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stumps!&rdquo; exclaimed Kinney. &ldquo;What a strange name. Too strange to be true.
      It&rsquo;s an alias!&rdquo; I was incensed that Kinney should charge the friends of
      the lovely lady with being criminals. Had it been any one else I would
      have at once resented it, but to be angry with Kinney is difficult. I
      could not help but remember that he is the slave of his own imagination.
      It plays tricks and runs away with him. And if it leads him to believe
      innocent people are criminals, it also leads him to believe that every
      woman in the Subway to whom he gives his seat is a great lady, a leader of
      society on her way to work in the slums.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;Those men aren&rsquo;t criminals. I talked to that
      Irishman, and he hasn&rsquo;t sense enough to be a criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The railroads are watched,&rdquo; repeated Kinney. &ldquo;Do HONEST men care a darn
      whether the railroad is watched or not? Do you care? Do I care? And did
      you notice how angry the American got when he found Stumps talking with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had noticed it; and I also recalled the fact that Stumps had said to the
      lovely lady: &ldquo;He told me I could come on deck as soon as we started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words seemed to bear out what Kinney claimed he had overheard. But not
      wishing to encourage him, of what I had heard I said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be dodging a summons,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;He is wanted, probably, only
      as a witness. It might be a civil suit, or his chauffeur may have hit
      somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinney shook his head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I fear you lack imagination. Those men are
      rascals, dangerous rascals, and the woman is their accomplice. What they
      have done I don&rsquo;t know, but I have already learned enough to arrest them
      as suspicious characters. Listen! Each of them has a separate state-room
      forward. The window of the American&rsquo;s room was open, and his suit-case was
      on the bed. On it were the initials H. P. A. The stateroom is number
      twenty-four, but when I examined the purser&rsquo;s list, pretending I wished to
      find out if a friend of mine was on board, I found that the man in
      twenty-four had given his name as James Preston. Now,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;why
      should one of them hide under an alias and the other be afraid to show
      himself until we leave the wharf?&rdquo; He did not wait for my answer. &ldquo;I have
      been talking to Mr. H. P. A., ALIAS Preston,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I pretended I
      was a person of some importance. I hinted I was rich. My object,&rdquo; Kinney
      added hastily, &ldquo;was to encourage him to try some of his tricks on ME; to
      try to rob ME; so that I could obtain evidence. I also,&rdquo; he went on, with
      some embarrassment, &ldquo;told him that you, too, were wealthy and of some
      importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought of the lovely lady, and I felt myself blushing indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did very wrong,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;you had no right! You may involve us both
      most unpleasantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not involved in any way,&rdquo; protested Kinney. &ldquo;As soon as we reach
      New Bedford you can slip on shore and wait for me at the hotel. When I&rsquo;ve
      finished with these gentlemen, I&rsquo;ll join you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finished with them!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;What do you mean to do to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest them!&rdquo; cried Kinney sternly, &ldquo;as soon as they step upon the
      wharf!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; I gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I HAVE done it!&rdquo; answered Kinney. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good as done. I have notified the
      chief of police at New Bedford,&rdquo; he declared proudly, &ldquo;to meet me at the
      wharf. I used the wireless. Here is my message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From his pocket he produced a paper and, with great importance, read
      aloud: &ldquo;Meet me at wharf on arrival steamer Patience. Two well-known
      criminals on board escaping New York police. Will personally lay charges
      against them.&mdash;Forbes Kinney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I could recover from my surprise, I made violent protest. I
      pointed out to Kinney that his conduct was outrageous, that in making such
      serious charges, on such evidence, he would lay himself open to
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not in the least dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it then,&rdquo; he said importantly, &ldquo;that you do not wish to appear
      against them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to appear in it at all!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to annoy
      that young lady. You must wire the police you are mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no desire to arrest the woman,&rdquo; said Kinney stiffly. &ldquo;In my
      message I did not mention HER. If you want an adventure of your own, you
      might help her to escape while I arrest her accomplices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I object,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;to your applying the word &lsquo;accomplice&rsquo; to that young
      lady. And suppose they ARE criminals,&rdquo; I demanded, &ldquo;how will arresting
      them help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinney&rsquo;s eyes flashed with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of the newspapers,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll be full of it!&rdquo; Already in
      imagination he saw the headlines. &ldquo;&lsquo;A Clever Haul!&rsquo;&rdquo; he quoted. &ldquo;&lsquo;Noted
      band of crooks elude New York police, but are captured by Forbes Kinney.&rsquo;&rdquo;
       He sighed contentedly. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll probably print my picture, too,&rdquo; he
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew I should be angry with him, but instead I could only feel sorry. I
      have known Kinney for a year, and I have learned that his &ldquo;make-believe&rdquo;
       is always innocent. I suppose that he is what is called a snob, but with
      him snobbishness is not an unpleasant weakness. In his case it takes the
      form of thinking that people who have certain things he does not possess
      are better than himself; and that, therefore, they must be worth knowing,
      and he tries to make their acquaintance. But he does not think that he
      himself is better than any one. His life is very bare and narrow. In
      consequence, on many things he places false values. As, for example, his
      desire to see his name in the newspapers even as an amateur detective. So,
      while I was indignant I also was sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re going to get yourself into an awful lot of trouble,
      and though I am not in this adventure, you know if I can help you I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thanked me and we went to the dining-saloon. There, at a table near
      ours, we saw the lovely lady and Stumps and the American. She again smiled
      at me, but this time, so it seemed, a little doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mind of the American, on the contrary, there was no doubt. He
      glared both at Kinney and myself, as though he would like to boil us in
      oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, in spite of my protests, Kinney set forth to interview him
      and, as he described it, to &ldquo;lead him on&rdquo; to commit himself. I feared
      Kinney was much more likely to commit himself than the other, and when I
      saw them seated together I watched from a distance with much anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, while I was alone, a steward told me the purser would like
      to see me. I went to his office, and found gathered there Stumps, his
      American friend, the night watchman of the boat, and the purser. As though
      inviting him to speak, the purser nodded to the American. That gentleman
      addressed me in an excited and belligerent manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Aldrich,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I want to know what YOUR name is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not quite like his tone, nor did I like being summoned to the
      purser&rsquo;s office to be questioned by a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Aldrich, &ldquo;it seems you have SEVERAL names. As one of them
      belongs to THIS gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed at Stumps&mdash;&ldquo;he wants to
      know why you are using it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Stumps and he greeted me with the vague and genial smile that
      was habitual to him, but on being caught in the act by Aldrich he
      hurriedly frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never used any name but my own,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and,&rdquo; I added
      pleasantly, &ldquo;if I were choosing a name I wouldn&rsquo;t choose &lsquo;Stumps.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aldrich fairly gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is not Stumps!&rdquo; he cried indignantly. &ldquo;He is the Earl of Ivy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He evidently expected me to be surprised at this, and I WAS surprised. I
      stared at the much-advertised young Irishman with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aldrich misunderstood my silence, and in a triumphant tone, which was far
      from pleasant, continued: &ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; he sneered, &ldquo;when you chose to
      pass yourself off as Ivy you should have picked out another boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thing was too absurd for me to be angry, and I demanded with patience:
      &ldquo;But why should I pass myself off as Lord Ivy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we intend to find out,&rdquo; snapped Aldrich. &ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;ve
      stopped your game for to-night, and to-morrow you can explain to the
      police! Your pal,&rdquo; he taunted, &ldquo;has told every one on this boat that you
      are Lord Ivy, and he&rsquo;s told me lies enough about HIMSELF to prove HE&rsquo;S an
      impostor, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw what had happened, and that if I were to protect poor Kinney I must
      not, as I felt inclined, use my fists, but my head. I laughed with
      apparent unconcern, and turned to the purser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I might have known it was Kinney; he&rsquo;s
      always playing practical jokes on me.&rdquo; I turned to Aldrich. &ldquo;My friend has
      been playing a joke on you, too,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know who you were,
      but he saw you were an Anglomaniac, and he&rsquo;s been having fun with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he?&rdquo; roared Aldrich. He reached down into his pocket and pulled out a
      piece of paper. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he cried, shaking it at me, &ldquo;is a copy of a
      wireless that I&rsquo;ve just sent to the chief of police at New Bedford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With great satisfaction he read it in a loud and threatening voice: &ldquo;Two
      impostors on this boat representing themselves to be Lord Ivy, my future
      brother-in-law, and his secretary. Lord Ivy himself on board. Send police
      to meet boat. We will make charges.&mdash;Henry Philip Aldrich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me that after receiving two such sensational telegrams, and
      getting out of bed to meet the boat at six in the morning, the chief of
      police would be in a state of mind to arrest almost anybody, and that his
      choice would certainly fall on Kinney and myself. It was ridiculous, but
      it also was likely to prove extremely humiliating. So I said, speaking to
      Lord Ivy: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a mistake all around; send for Mr. Kinney and I
      will explain it to you.&rdquo; Lord Ivy, who was looking extremely bored, smiled
      and nodded, but young Aldrich laughed ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kinney is in his state-room,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with a steward guarding the
      door and window. You can explain to-morrow to the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rounded indignantly upon the purser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you keeping Mr. Kinney a prisoner in his state-room?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;If
      you are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have to stay there,&rdquo; protested the purser sulkily. &ldquo;When he
      found the stewards were following him he went to his cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see him at once,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And if I catch any of your stewards
      following ME, I&rsquo;ll drop them overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one tried to stop me&mdash;indeed, knowing I could not escape, they
      seemed pleased at my departure, and I went to my cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kinney, seated on the edge of the berth, greeted me with a hollow groan.
      His expression was one of utter misery. As though begging me not to be
      angry, he threw out his arms appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the devil!&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;was I to know that a little red-headed shrimp
      like that was the Earl of Ivy? And that that tall blonde girl,&rdquo; he added
      indignantly, &ldquo;that I thought was an accomplice, is Lady Moya, his sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kinney was wearing his hat. He took it off and hurled it to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was that damned hat!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Harvard ribbon, all right, but
      only men on the crew can wear it! How was I to know THAT? I saw Aldrich
      looking at it in a puzzled way, and when he said, &lsquo;I see you are on the
      crew,&rsquo; I guessed what it meant, and said I was on last year&rsquo;s crew.
      Unfortunately HE was on last year&rsquo;s crew! That&rsquo;s what made him suspect me,
      and after dinner he put me through a third degree. I must have given the
      wrong answers, for suddenly he jumped up and called me a swindler and an
      impostor. I got back by telling him he was a crook and that I was a
      detective, and that I had sent a wireless to have him arrested at New
      Bedford. He challenged me to prove I was a detective, and, of course, I
      couldn&rsquo;t, and he called up two stewards and told them to watch me while he
      went after the purser. I didn&rsquo;t fancy being watched, so I came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you tell him I was the Earl of Ivy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinney ran his fingers through his hair and groaned dismally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was before the boat started,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it was only a joke. He
      didn&rsquo;t seem to be interested in my conversation, so I thought I&rsquo;d liven it
      up a bit by saying I was a friend of Lord Ivy&rsquo;s. And you happened to pass,
      and I happened to remember Mrs. Shaw saying you looked like a British
      peer, so I said: &lsquo;That is my friend Lord Ivy.&rsquo; I said I was your
      secretary, and he seemed greatly interested, and&mdash;&rdquo; Kinney added
      dismally, &ldquo;I talked too much. I am SO sorry,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be
      awful for you!&rdquo; His eyes suddenly lit with hope. &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; he whispered,
      &ldquo;we can escape!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same thought was in my mind, but the idea was absurd, and
      impracticable. I knew there was no escape. I knew we were sentenced at
      sunrise to a most humiliating and disgraceful experience. The newspapers
      would regard anything that concerned Lord Ivy as news. In my turn I also
      saw the hideous head-lines. What would my father and mother at Fairport
      think; what would my old friends there think; and, what was of even
      greater importance, how would Joyce &amp; Carboy act? What chance was
      there left me, after I had been arrested as an impostor, to become a
      stenographer in the law courts&mdash;in time, a member of the bar? But I
      found that what, for the moment, distressed me most was that the lovely
      lady would consider me a knave or a fool. The thought made me exclaim with
      exasperation. Had it been possible to abandon Kinney, I would have dropped
      overboard and made for shore. The night was warm and foggy, and the short
      journey to land, to one who had been brought up like a duck, meant nothing
      more than a wetting. But I did not see how I could desert Kinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you swim?&rdquo; I asked
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; he answered gloomily; &ldquo;and, besides,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;our
      names are on our suitcases. We couldn&rsquo;t take them with us, and they&rsquo;d find
      out who we are. If we could only steal a boat!&rdquo; he exclaimed eagerly&mdash;&ldquo;one
      of those on the davits,&rdquo; he urged&mdash;&ldquo;we could put our suitcases in it
      and then, after every one is asleep, we could lower it into the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smallest boat on board was certified to hold twenty-five persons, and
      without waking the entire ship&rsquo;s company we could as easily have moved the
      chart-room. This I pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make objections!&rdquo; Kinney cried petulantly. He was rapidly
      recovering his spirits. The imminence of danger seemed to inspire him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Think of some way by which we can get off this
      boat before she reaches New Bedford. We MUST! We must not be arrested! It
      would be too awful!&rdquo; He interrupted himself with an excited exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely: &ldquo;I will ring in the fire-alarm! The
      crew will run to quarters. The boats will be lowered. We will cut one of
      them adrift. In the confusion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was to happen in the confusion that his imagination had conjured up,
      I was not to know. For what actually happened was so confused that of
      nothing am I quite certain. First, from the water of the Sound, that was
      lapping pleasantly against the side, I heard the voice of a man raised in
      terror. Then came a rush of feet, oaths, and yells; then a shock that
      threw us to our knees, and a crunching, ripping, and tearing roar like
      that made by the roof of a burning building when it plunges to the cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the next instant a large bowsprit entered our cabin window. There was
      left me just space enough to wrench the door open, and grabbing Kinney,
      who was still on his knees, I dragged him into the alleyway. He scrambled
      upright and clasped his hands to his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my hat?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could hear the water pouring into the lower deck and sweeping the
      freight and trunks before it. A horse in a box stall was squealing like a
      human being, and many human beings were screaming and shrieking like
      animals. My first intelligent thought was of the lovely lady. I shook
      Kinney by the arm. The uproar was so great that to make him hear I was
      forced to shout. &ldquo;Where is Lord Ivy&rsquo;s cabin?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;You said it&rsquo;s next
      to his sister&rsquo;s. Take me there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinney nodded, and ran down the corridor and into an alleyway on which
      opened three cabins. The doors were ajar, and as I looked into each I saw
      that the beds had not been touched, and that the cabins were empty. I knew
      then that she was still on deck. I felt that I must find her. We ran
      toward the companionway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women and children first!&rdquo; Kinney was yelling. &ldquo;Women and children
      first!&rdquo; As we raced down the slanting floor of the saloon he kept
      repeating this mechanically. At that moment the electric lights went out,
      and, except for the oil lamps, the ship was in darkness. Many of the
      passengers had already gone to bed. These now burst from the state-rooms
      in strange garments, carrying life-preservers, hand-bags, their arms full
      of clothing. One man in one hand clutched a sponge, in the other an
      umbrella. With this he beat at those who blocked his flight. He hit a
      woman over the head, and I hit him and he went down. Finding himself on
      his knees, he began to pray volubly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the upper deck we pushed out of the crush at the gangway
      and, to keep our footing, for there was a strong list to port, clung to
      the big flag-staff at the stern. At each rail the crew were swinging the
      boats over the side, and around each boat was a crazy, fighting mob. Above
      our starboard rail towered the foremast of a schooner. She had rammed us
      fair amidships, and in her bows was a hole through which you could have
      rowed a boat. Into this the water was rushing and sucking her down. She
      was already settling at the stern. By the light of a swinging lantern I
      saw three of her crew lift a yawl from her deck and lower it into the
      water. Into it they hurled oars and a sail, and one of them had already
      started to slide down the painter when the schooner lurched drunkenly; and
      in a panic all three of the men ran forward and leaped to our lower deck.
      The yawl, abandoned, swung idly between the Patience and the schooner.
      Kinney, seeing what I saw, grabbed me by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he whispered, pointing; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s our chance!&rdquo; I saw that, with
      safety, the yawl could hold a third person, and as to who the third
      passenger would be I had already made up my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait here!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Patience there were many immigrants, only that afternoon released
      from Ellis Island. They had swarmed into the life-boats even before they
      were swung clear, and when the ship&rsquo;s officers drove them off, the poor
      souls, not being able to understand, believed they were being sacrificed
      for the safety of the other passengers. So each was fighting, as he
      thought, for his life and for the lives of his wife and children. At the
      edge of the scrimmage I dragged out two women who had been knocked off
      their feet and who were in danger of being trampled. But neither was the
      woman I sought. In the half-darkness I saw one of the immigrants, a girl
      with a &lsquo;kerchief on her head, struggling with her life-belt. A stoker, as
      he raced past, seized it and made for the rail. In my turn I took it from
      him, and he fought for it, shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s every man for himself now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said, for I was excited and angry, &ldquo;look out for YOURSELF
      then!&rdquo; I hit him on the chin, and he let go of the life-belt and dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard at my elbow a low, excited laugh, and a voice said: &ldquo;Well bowled!
      You never learned that in an office.&rdquo; I turned and saw the lovely lady. I
      tossed the immigrant girl her life-belt, and as though I had known Lady
      Moya all my life I took her by the hand and dragged her after me down the
      deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come with me!&rdquo; I commanded. I found that I was trembling and that a
      weight of anxiety of which I had not been conscious had been lifted. I
      found I was still holding her hand and pressing it in my own. &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;
       I said. &ldquo;I thought I had lost you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost me!&rdquo; repeated Lady Moya. But she made no comment. &ldquo;I must find my
      brother,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come with me!&rdquo; I ordered. &ldquo;Go with Mr. Kinney to the lower deck.
      I will bring that rowboat under the stern. You will jump into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot leave my brother!&rdquo; said Lady Moya.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the word, as though shot from a cannon, the human whirlpool that was
      sweeping the deck amidships cast out Stumps and hurled him toward us. His
      sister gave a little cry of relief. Stumps recovered his balance and shook
      himself like a dog that has been in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d never get out of it alive!&rdquo; he remarked complacently. In the
      darkness I could not see his face, but I was sure he was still vaguely
      smiling. &ldquo;Worse than a foot-ball night!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;worse than
      Mafeking night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sister pointed to the yawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman is going to bring that boat here and take us away in it,&rdquo;
       she told him. &ldquo;We had better go when we can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right ho!&rdquo; assented Stumps cheerfully. &ldquo;How about Phil? He&rsquo;s just behind
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, only a few yards from us a peevish voice pierced the tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; it cried, &ldquo;you must find Lord Ivy! If Lord Ivy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice with a strong and brutal American accent yelled in answer: &ldquo;To
      hell with Lord Ivy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Moya chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get to the lower deck!&rdquo; I commanded. &ldquo;I am going for the yawl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I slipped my leg over the rail I heard Lord Ivy say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find Phil
      and meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dropped and caught the rail of the deck below, and, hanging from it,
      shoved with my knees and fell into the water. Two strokes brought me to
      the yawl, and, scrambling into her and casting her off, I paddled back to
      the steamer. As I lay under the stern I heard from the lower deck the
      voice of Kinney raised importantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies first!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Her ladyship first, I mean,&rdquo; he corrected. Even
      on leaving what he believed to be a sinking ship, Kinney could not forget
      his manners. But Mr. Aldrich had evidently forgotten his. I heard him
      shout indignantly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be damned if I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Lady Moya laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be drowned if you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she answered. I saw a black shadow
      poised upon the rail. &ldquo;Steady below there!&rdquo; her voice called, and the next
      moment, as lightly as a squirrel, she dropped to the thwart and stumbled
      into my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Aldrich was again raised in anger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather drown!&rdquo; he
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ivy responded with unexpected spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, drown! The water is warm and it&rsquo;s a pleasing death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that, with a bump, he fell in a heap at my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy, Kinney!&rdquo; I shouted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t swamp us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful!&rdquo; he called, and the next instant hit my shoulders and I
      shook him off on top of Lord Ivy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get off my head!&rdquo; shouted his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kinney apologized to every one profusely. Lady Moya raised her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the last time, Phil,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;are you coming or are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with those swindlers, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I think you two are mad!
      I prefer to drown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an uncomfortable silence. My position was a difficult one, and,
      not knowing what to say, I said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one must drown!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Moya briskly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it matters
      who one drowns with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his strangely explosive manner Lord Ivy shouted suddenly: &ldquo;Phil, you&rsquo;re
      a silly ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Push off!&rdquo; commanded Lady Moya.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think, from her tone, the order was given more for the benefit of
      Aldrich than for myself. Certainly it was effective, for on the instant
      there was a heavy splash. Lord Ivy sniffed scornfully and manifested no
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;he prefers to drown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sputtering and gasping, Aldrich rose out of the water, and, while we
      balanced the boat, climbed over the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand!&rdquo; he cried even while he was still gasping, &ldquo;I am here under
      protest. I am here to protect you and Stumps. I am under obligation to no
      one. I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you row?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask your pal?&rdquo; he demanded savagely; &ldquo;he rowed on last
      year&rsquo;s crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil!&rdquo; cried Lady Moya. Her voice suggested a temper I had not suspected.
      &ldquo;You will row or you can get out and walk! Take the oars,&rdquo; she commanded,
      &ldquo;and be civil!&rdquo; Lady Moya, with the tiller in her hand, sat in the stern;
      Stumps, with Kinney huddled at his knees, was stowed away forward. I took
      the stroke and Aldrich the bow oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will make for the Connecticut shore,&rdquo; I said, and pulled from under
      the stern of the Patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes we had lost all sight and, except for her whistle, all
      sound of her; and we ourselves were lost in the fog. There was another
      eloquent and embarrassing silence. Unless, in the panic, they trampled
      upon each other, I had no real fear for the safety of those on board the
      steamer. Before we had abandoned her I had heard the wireless frantically
      sputtering the &ldquo;standby&rdquo; call, and I was certain that already the big
      boats of the Fall River, Providence, and Joy lines, and launches from
      every wireless station between Bridgeport and Newport, were making toward
      her. But the margin of safety, which to my thinking was broad enough for
      all the other passengers, for the lovely lady was in no way sufficient.
      That mob-swept deck was no place for her. I was happy that, on her
      account, I had not waited for a possible rescue. In the yawl she was safe.
      The water was smooth, and the Connecticut shore was, I judged, not more
      than three miles distant. In an hour, unless the fog confused us, I felt
      sure the lovely lady would again walk safely upon dry land. Selfishly, on
      Kinney&rsquo;s account and my own, I was delighted to find myself free of the
      steamer, and from any chance of her landing us where police waited with
      open arms. The avenging angel in the person of Aldrich was still near us,
      so near that I could hear the water dripping from his clothes, but his
      power to harm was gone. I was congratulating myself on this when suddenly
      he undeceived me. Apparently he had been considering his position toward
      Kinney and myself, and, having arrived at a conclusion, was anxious to
      announce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to repeat,&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m under obligations to
      nobody. Just because my friends,&rdquo; he went on defiantly, &ldquo;choose to trust
      themselves with persons who ought to be in jail, I can&rsquo;t desert them. It&rsquo;s
      all the more reason why I SHOULDN&rsquo;T desert them. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here! And
      I want it understood as soon as I get on shore I&rsquo;m going to a police
      station and have those persons arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rising out of the fog that had rendered each of us invisible to the other,
      his words sounded fantastic and unreal. In the dripping silence, broken
      only by hoarse warnings that came from no direction, and within the mind
      of each the conviction that we were lost, police stations did not
      immediately concern us. So no one spoke, and in the fog the words died
      away and were drowned. But I was glad he had spoken. At least I was
      forewarned. I now knew that I had not escaped, that Kinney and I were
      still in danger. I determined that so far as it lay with me, our yawl
      would be beached at that point on the coast of Connecticut farthest
      removed, not only from police stations, but from all human habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we were out of hearing of the Patience and her whistle, we
      completely lost our bearings. It may be that Lady Moya was not a skilled
      coxswain, or it may be that Aldrich understands a racing scull better than
      a yawl, and pulled too heavily on his right, but whatever the cause we
      soon were hopelessly lost. In this predicament we were not alone. The
      night was filled with fog-horns, whistles, bells, and the throb of
      engines, but we never were near enough to hail the vessels from which the
      sounds came, and when we rowed toward them they invariably sank into
      silence. After two hours Stumps and Kinney insisted on taking a turn at
      the oars, and Lady Moya moved to the bow. We gave her our coats, and,
      making cushions of these, she announced that she was going to sleep.
      Whether she slept or not, I do not know, but she remained silent. For
      three more dreary hours we took turns at the oars or dozed at the bottom
      of the boat while we continued aimlessly to drift upon the face of the
      waters. It was now five o&rsquo;clock, and the fog had so far lightened that we
      could see each other and a stretch of open water. At intervals the
      fog-horns of vessels passing us, but hidden from us, tormented Aldrich to
      a state of extreme exasperation. He hailed them with frantic shrieks and
      shouts, and Stumps and the Lady Moya shouted with him. I fear Kinney and
      myself did not contribute any great volume of sound to the general chorus.
      To be &ldquo;rescued&rdquo; was the last thing we desired. The yacht or tug that would
      receive us on board would also put us on shore, where the vindictive
      Aldrich would have us at his mercy. We preferred the freedom of our yawl
      and the shelter of the fog. Our silence was not lost upon Aldrich. For
      some time he had been crouching in the bow, whispering indignantly to Lady
      Moya; now he exclaimed aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; he cried contemptuously; &ldquo;they got away in this
      boat because they were afraid of ME, not because they were afraid of being
      drowned. If they&rsquo;ve nothing to be afraid of, why are they so anxious to
      keep us drifting around all night in this fog? Why don&rsquo;t they help us stop
      one of those tugs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ivy exploded suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re afraid of you, why did they ask you to go
      with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Aldrich, truthfully and triumphantly. &ldquo;They kidnapped
      you and Moya because they thought they could square themselves with YOU.
      But they didn&rsquo;t want ME!&rdquo; The issue had been fairly stated, and no longer
      with self-respect could I remain silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you now!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand,&rdquo; I went on with as
      much self-restraint as I could muster, &ldquo;we are willing and anxious to
      explain ourselves to Lord Ivy, or even to you, but we don&rsquo;t want to
      explain to the police? My friend thought you and Lord Ivy were crooks,
      escaping. You think WE are crooks, escaping. You both&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aldrich snorted contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a likely story!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;No wonder you don&rsquo;t want to tell THAT
      to the police!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the bow came an exclamation, and Lady Moya rose to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you bore me!&rdquo; She picked her way across the thwart to
      where Kinney sat at the stroke oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother and I often row together,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I will take your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had seated herself we were so near that her eyes looked directly
      into mine. Drawing in the oars, she leaned upon them and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;tell us all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could speak there came from behind her a sudden radiance, and as
      though a curtain had been snatched aside, the fog flew apart, and the sun,
      dripping, crimson, and gorgeous, sprang from the waters. From the others
      there was a cry of wonder and delight, and from Lord Ivy a shriek of
      incredulous laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Moya clapped her hands joyfully and pointed past me. I turned and
      looked. Directly behind me, not fifty feet from us, was a shelving beach
      and a stone wharf, and above it a vine-covered cottage, from the chimney
      of which smoke curled cheerily. Had the yawl, while Lady Moya was taking
      the oars, NOT swung in a circle, and had the sun NOT risen, in three
      minutes more we would have bumped ourselves into the State of Connecticut.
      The cottage stood on one horn of a tiny harbor. Beyond it, weather-beaten
      shingled houses, sail-lofts, and wharfs stretched cosily in a half-circle.
      Back of them rose splendid elms and the delicate spire of a church, and
      from the unruffled surface of the harbor the masts of many fishing-boats.
      Across the water, on a grass-grown point, a whitewashed light-house
      blushed in the crimson glory of the sun. Except for an oyster-man in his
      boat at the end of the wharf, and the smoke from the chimney of his
      cottage, the little village slept, the harbor slept. It was a picture of
      perfect content, confidence, and peace. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the Lady Moya, &ldquo;how
      pretty, how pretty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ivy swung the bow about and raced toward the wharf. The others stood
      up and cheered hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound and at the sight of us emerging so mysteriously from the fog,
      the man in the fishing-boat raised himself to his full height and stared
      as incredulously as though he beheld a mermaid. He was an old man, but
      straight and tall, and the oysterman&rsquo;s boots stretching to his hips made
      him appear even taller than he was. He had a bristling white beard and his
      face was tanned to a fierce copper color, but his eyes were blue and young
      and gentle. They lit suddenly with excitement and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you from the Patience?&rdquo; he shouted. In chorus we answered that we
      were, and Ivy pulled the yawl alongside the fisherman&rsquo;s boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But already the old man had turned and, making a megaphone of his hands,
      was shouting to the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;mother, here are folks from the wreck. Get coffee and
      blankets and&mdash;and bacon&mdash;and eggs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the Lord bless him!&rdquo; exclaimed the Lady Moya devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Aldrich, excited and eager, pulled out a roll of bills and shook them
      at the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to earn ten dollars?&rdquo; he demanded; &ldquo;then chase yourself to
      the village and bring the constable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Moya exclaimed bitterly, Lord Ivy swore, Kinney in despair uttered a
      dismal howl and dropped his head in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Mr. Aldrich,&rdquo; I said. Seated in the stern, the others had
      hidden me from the fisherman. Now I stood up and he saw me. I laid one
      hand on his, and pointed to the tin badge on his suspender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the village constable himself,&rdquo; I explained. I turned to the lovely
      lady. &ldquo;Lady Moya,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I want to introduce you to my father!&rdquo; I
      pointed to the vine-covered cottage. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my home,&rdquo; I said. I pointed
      to the sleeping town. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; I told her, &ldquo;is the village of Fairport.
      Most of it belongs to father. You are all very welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
